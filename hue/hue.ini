    # Database engine is typically one of:
    # postgresql_psycopg2, mysql, sqlite3 or oracle.
    #
    # Note that for sqlite3, 'name', below is a path to the filename. For other backends, it is the database name
    # Note for Oracle, options={"threaded":true} must be set in order to avoid crashes.
    # Note for Oracle, you can use the Oracle Service Name by setting "host=" and "port=" and then "name=<host>:<port>/<service_name>".
